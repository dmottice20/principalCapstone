## Project Overview: Fixed Income Portfolio Strategy using Machine Learning

This project is a recreation of my undergraduate research conducted at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) during the 2019-2020 academic year. The original research focused on developing a portfolio strategy for fixed income markets using machine learning techniques.

### Background

During my capstone project at USAFA, I explored the application of machine learning algorithms to create an effective portfolio strategy in the fixed income market. The original project utilized real market data and demonstrated promising results in optimizing portfolio allocation and performance.

### Current Recreation

Due to the unavailability of the original dataset, this project aims to recreate the research methodology and findings using simulated or publicly available data. The primary goal is to maintain consistency with the original research by implementing the same algorithms and approaches used in the undergraduate project.

### Key Features

1. Implementation of machine learning algorithms for fixed income portfolio optimization
2. Simulation of market data to replicate real-world scenarios
3. Comparative analysis of different ML models in portfolio strategy development
4. Performance evaluation metrics and visualization tools

### Methodology

The project will follow these main steps:

1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. Feature engineering and selection
3. Model development and training
4. Portfolio optimization based on model predictions
5. Performance evaluation and backtesting

### Future Work

While this project focuses on recreating the original research, future work and related repositories will explore more advanced methods, including:

1. Deep learning approaches for fixed income portfolio management
2. Integration of natural language processing for market sentiment analysis
3. Reinforcement learning techniques for dynamic portfolio rebalancing
4. Incorporation of alternative data sources to enhance predictive power
